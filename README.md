# Hybrid Off-Grid and On-Grid Solar System

## Introduction
This project is a **Hybrid Solar System** that integrates both off-grid and on-grid functionalities. The system is designed to optimize energy efficiency by allowing the user to switch between the two modes and reuse waste energy effectively. The hybrid system ensures energy reliability while minimizing wastage, making it ideal for areas with inconsistent power supply or the need for energy conservation.

## Features
- **Switch Between Off-Grid and On-Grid Systems**: A manual switch allows easy toggling between off-grid and on-grid operations.
- **Energy Reuse**: Maximizes the reuse of excess solar energy that would otherwise go to waste.
- **Sustainable Power Source**: Provides a reliable energy solution for both independent (off-grid) and grid-tied (on-grid) usage.
- **Seamless Control**: The system is easy to operate with a user-friendly interface for switching power modes.

## Installation / Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Install solar panels and connect them to the charge controller.
   - Connect the charge controller to the battery for off-grid use.
   - Wire the inverter to the main power system for on-grid use.
   - Implement the manual switch to toggle between off-grid and on-grid modes.

2. **Software Setup** (if applicable):
   - Configure any monitoring software to track energy usage and performance.

3. **Powering the System**:
   - Switch to off-grid mode when solar energy is available and the battery is charged.
   - Switch to on-grid mode to use grid power or feed excess solar power back into the grid.

## Usage
- **Off-Grid Mode**: The system draws energy from the battery, ideal for areas without grid connectivity.
- **On-Grid Mode**: The system can feed energy into the grid, reusing surplus energy efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Solar Panels**
- **Inverter**
- **Charge Controller**
- **Battery Storage**
- **Manual Switch for Off-Grid/On-Grid Control**
